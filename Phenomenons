Age and Gender Phenomens:
  1. More than 75% of our customers are males. 
  2. However, our female ridership has grown through out the year. 
  3. We were able to attract 100% more female riders in December than we did in January. Assuming these are comparable months based on weather and time of year, one can argue that female ridership increase throughout the year.

Location Phenomenons:
  1. People seem to gravitate to our most popular stations, as these top stations rarely change month to month.
  2. As Jersey city continues to grow our restaurants and commercial buildings, the neighboring stations will see an increase in traffic.
